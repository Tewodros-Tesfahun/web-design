		My name is Tewodros Tesfahun Gebrehiwot. I was born on March 19, 2001 in Addis Ababa,
        Ethiopia. My parents are Tesfahun Gebrehiwot and Tsige Tedla. I have one
        older brother. His name is Henok Tesfahun. I was named Tewodros after
        the hero of Meqdella Atse Tewodros. But I was also given another name
        Nahom. Now I have two names. Most of my family call me Nahom but at
        school they call me Teddy.

		There a lot of things I like and that I don't like. I like to
        have fun with my friends, but most of all I love to watch movies. There
        are times I don't see the outside the whole day but I just sit inside
        and watch movies. The thing I don't like is milk, I don't know why I
        just hate it. I also hate eating fish. So far I've told you about things
        I don't like about food, but the biggest thing I hate in this world is
        to be bored.

					<p>
		From LKG to the 9<sup>th</sup> grade, I attended a school called Lucy
        adademy. I was planning on finishing there but it got closed. So I went
        to a boarding school called Akaki Adventist School. But I was not a
        boarding student. I finished my highschool education there. Then I got
        into Ethiopian institution of Architecture, Building Construction and
        City Development(EiABC). And now I am currently learning the second
        semester of my first year undergraduate education.

What is your vision for the future? What is your purpose in life? What gets you out of bed every
morning? These are questions we must constantly ask ourselves. As a college student, these are
questions that are drowned out by the noise of academia, but as a young entrepreneur these are
questions I ask myself daily. Everyone has a different goal that they want to achieve; some have
seemingly almost impossible goals while some are somewhat more content with little things,
setting their focus on easily achievable goals. There is no human being that does not have a goal
at some point; whether being the president of their country or simply waking up early for an 8 am
class. The reason for setting goals is to achieve a vision, to get to a particular level that you desire
for yourself or become something that you want to be. In ten years’ time, I want to be an architect
working in one of the biggest architectural firms in Ethiopia.<br /><br /> I have a vision for change that has
come from a longing of something more by a Power greater than myself.Gandhi once said, “Be the
change you wish to see in the world.” I read this quote everyday and I have made the decision to
stop complaining about the world I live in and take action to change a world I believe in. It is my
goal to inspire people's imaginations again. To cause them to dream new dreams and remember
old dreams that society forced them to forget. I want to help people become more than they every
thought they could. It is my goal to bring business to the streets and end poverty. I think people
have forgot how to have fun in this world and cherish true friendships and genuine fun. My goal is
simply to walk in integrity and brighten this world with other's people’s smiles. People have
forgotten what it is like to love, to laugh, and to dance, and to cry. To accomplish my goals and to
live my dreams I know I need a plan.<br /><br /> I have learned that any dream is just a fantasy if you don’t
have a thought out, concrete plan of action that leads to the finish line. I know I will live my vision. I
know my dreams will come true. I won’t sleep until the mission is complete.My plan is to build an
unmovable foundation during my college years and prepare my heart and mind for the challenges
ahead. Mistakes will come through challenging experiences, but I know that we learn best through
the art of doing. I know that I will sometimes fail, but failure to me is just an opportunity to grow. I
am a leader in organizations on my campus and use this opportunity to develop myself as a true
leader.

I am interested in anything that is interesting. Eclecticity seeps into my brain much more easily than
the thunderingly similar data of a single concentrated topic area. Though I tend to gravitate
towards computer, science, and math information, Most of all I like watching movies and I spend a lot
of time thinking how I would have written the scenes or how the ending should have been. One
day I would like to write a script of my own and have it turn into a movie.<br />
Though I do not spend most of my daily time actively engaging in monastic exercises of personal
study and reflection, or even in what would popularly be considered religious activity, I have
determined to mold my entire life, moment by moment, in a way that is pleasing to God. This is my
greatest interest.<br />
I like reading science fiction books. Mainly everyone has a favorite book, but I really don’t. There
are just too many to chose from and it is hard to say that I like a certain book over another book. But
if I have to say I will choose the 'Iam Number Four' book series by Pittacus Lore.
